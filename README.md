# YouTube Custom CSS Theme

Use a tool that lets you inject custom CSS into websites, like [Requestly](https://www.requestly.io/).

1. Create a **New Rule**, set **URL and set Contains**.  

2. In the URL field, enter: `https://www.youtube.com/` and save settings.

3. Open/Reload Youtube.

4. And if you did everything correct Youtube should look different now.

This is a basic theme example, you can tweak colors, add new styles, or completely redesign the layout to fit your own look. (:

Also to modify the theme around the media-player you have to use roundabout methods from what I know.
