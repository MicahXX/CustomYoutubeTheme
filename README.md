# YouTube Custom CSS Theme

Use a tool that lets you inject custom CSS into websites, like [Requestly](https://www.requestly.io/).

1. Create a **New Rule**, set **URL and set Contains**.  

2. In the URL field, enter: `https://www.youtube.com/`

3. Paste the content from the theme file into the text field and save settings.

4. Open/Reload Youtube.

5. And if you did everything correct Youtube should look different now.

This is a basic theme example, you can tweak colors, add new styles, or completely redesign the layout to fit your own look. (:

PS: To modify the theme around the media-player you have to use roundabout methods, since Youtube sets the color around to default again every time you load Youtube or just do any action on the browser.
