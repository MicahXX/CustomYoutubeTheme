# YouTube Custom CSS Theme

Use a tool that lets you inject custom CSS into websites, like [Requestly](https://www.requestly.io/).

1. Create a **New Rule**, set **URL and set Contains**.  

2. In the URL field, enter: `https://www.youtube.com/`

3. Open Youtube or reload tab.

4. And if you did everything correct Youtube should look different now.

This is a basic theme example, you can tweak colors, add new styles, or completely redesign the layout to fit your own look. (:
