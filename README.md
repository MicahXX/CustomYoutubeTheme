Use a tool that allows you to inject custom CSS into websites, such as Requestly.

Create a new rule and set the condition type to URL, Contains (this is important because when you click on a video,
YouTube dynamically redirects to a different page).

In the URL field, enter: https://www.youtube.com/

This is just a very basic theme example — you can customize and expand it as much as you want.
Feel free to modify the styles, add new elements, or completely redesign the layout to match your own aesthetic.
